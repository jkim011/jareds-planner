# jareds-planner

## Description

This application is a work day scheduler that is used to plan out your day. On top of the screen, the current day's date will be shown. Under it will be time blocks that are color coded based on the time of the day. The box is grey if that hour has passed, red if it is the current hour, and green for future hours. Anything typed in the text boxes can be saved and will stay there even if the page is refreshed.
